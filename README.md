# Fish Species Predictor

Deployed on: https://predict-fish-species.onrender.com/

This project is a web application that predicts the species of a fish based on various physical features such as weight, length, height, and width. The prediction model uses machine learning techniques and is deployed using Flask.

## Features

- **Predict Fish Species:** Users can input the physical characteristics of a fish to get the predicted species.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for data input.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Model:** The backend uses a pre-trained logistic regression model to make accurate predictions. The trainer notebook and dataset are also available.
